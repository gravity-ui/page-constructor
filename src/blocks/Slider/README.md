The slider supports two types of content: loadable and from a config. Loadable content is loaded via the `loadable` property and content from a config via the `children` property.

`type: "slider-block"`

`animated?: bool` — Enables/disables animation for the block (enabled by default).

`dots?: bool` — A flag that indicates whether to show navigation dots.

`arrows? bool` — A flag that indicates whether to show navigation arrows.

`title: Title`: Title.

`description?: string`: Description.

`randomOrder?: bool`: Enables a random slide order.

`slidesToShow?: Record<'all' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl', number> | number`: How many slides to show on screens of different width. Overrides the default values. They can be overridden for each screen width. You can also set a single numeric value so that the number of slides is always the same (except for mobiles, where the value is always 1).

Default values:

- `xl`: 3
- `lg`: 3
- `md`: 2
- `sm`: 1
