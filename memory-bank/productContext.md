# Product Context: Page Constructor

## Purpose

Page Constructor is a library designed to solve the challenge of creating and maintaining web pages with a consistent design system while allowing for flexibility and customization. It addresses the following problems:

1. **Content Management Complexity**: Traditional CMS systems often require technical knowledge or are too rigid for complex layouts.

2. **Design Consistency**: Maintaining consistent design across multiple pages and websites is challenging.

3. **Developer-Content Creator Gap**: Bridging the gap between developers who build components and content creators who assemble pages.

4. **Maintenance Overhead**: Updating designs across multiple pages requires significant effort without a component-based system.

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers

- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing React applications
- **Extensibility**: Ability to create custom blocks and extend functionality
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript typing for reliable development
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and loading for large pages
- **Customization**: Theming and styling flexibility to match brand requirements

### For Content Creators

- **Visual Editing**: WYSIWYG editor for creating and modifying pages
- **Component Library**: Ready-made blocks for common page elements
- **Real-time Preview**: Immediate visual feedback on changes
- **JSON/YAML Support**: Structured data format for page definition
- **Theme Switching**: Easy toggling between light and dark themes

### For End Users

- **Fast Loading**: Optimized performance for quick page rendering
- **Responsive Design**: Proper display across all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with accessibility standards
- **Consistent Experience**: Unified design language across pages
- **Interactive Elements**: Support for dynamic content and user interactions

## Key Workflows

### Page Creation

1. Developer integrates Page Constructor into their application
2. Content creator uses the editor to:
   - Select blocks from the component library
   - Configure block properties
   - Arrange blocks in the desired order
   - Preview the page in different device sizes and themes
3. The page is saved as JSON/YAML data
4. The application renders the page using the Page Constructor component

### Page Customization

1. Developer creates custom blocks specific to their application
2. Developer registers custom blocks with Page Constructor
3. Content creator can use both standard and custom blocks in the editor
4. The application renders the custom blocks alongside standard ones

### Content Transformation

1. Content is authored in Yandex Flavored Markdown (YFM)
2. Server utilities transform YFM to HTML
3. Transformed content is displayed within blocks
4. Typography and styling are applied consistently

## Integration Points

- **React Applications**: Primary integration as React components
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Support for SSR in Node.js environments
- **Analytics Systems**: Hooks for tracking user interactions
- **Map Services**: Integration with mapping providers
- **Form Handlers**: Connection to form processing services (Yandex Forms, Hubspot)
- **Internationalization**: Integration with i18n systems

## Value Proposition

Page Constructor empowers organizations to:

1. **Accelerate Development**: Reduce time to market with ready-made components
2. **Improve Consistency**: Maintain design coherence across digital properties
3. **Enhance Collaboration**: Enable non-technical team members to create and edit pages
4. **Reduce Maintenance**: Simplify updates and changes through component reuse
5. **Ensure Quality**: Maintain performance and accessibility standards
