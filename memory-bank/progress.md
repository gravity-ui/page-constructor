- **Customization**: Ability to register custom blocks and extend functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Grid system for responsive layouts
- **Animation**: Animation support for blocks
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages

### Block Library

The library includes a comprehensive set of blocks for various use cases:

- **Layout Blocks**: Header, ContentLayout, CardLayout
- **Content Blocks**: Media, Banner, Info, Table, Tabs
- **Interactive Blocks**: Slider, Questions, FoldableList, Form
- **Feature Blocks**: PromoFeatures, ExtendedFeatures, Icons
- **Integration Blocks**: Map, Share, Companies

### Editor

- **Visual Editing**: WYSIWYG editor for creating and modifying pages
- **Code Editing**: Support for direct JSON/YAML editing
- **Form-based Editing**: User-friendly forms for configuring block properties
- **Real-time Preview**: Immediate visual feedback on changes
- **Block Templates**: Pre-defined templates for common block configurations

### Server Utilities

- **Content Transformation**: Tools for transforming YFM to HTML
- **Typography Enhancement**: Typograf integration for text formatting
- **HTML Sanitization**: Security measures for user-generated content

## What's Left to Build

### Planned Enhancements

1. **YAML Support**: Enhancing support for YAML format beyond the current JSON focus
2. **Mobile Optimization**: Improving mobile experience for both editor and rendered pages
3. **Performance Enhancements**: Further optimizing bundle size and rendering performance
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensuring all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. **Documentation Expansion**: Adding more examples and use cases

### Technical Debt

1. **Legacy Support**: Addressing deprecated props and components
2. **Bundle Size Optimization**: Reducing bundle size and improving tree-shaking
3. **Test Coverage**: Expanding test coverage for edge cases
4. **Code Refactoring**: Improving code organization and reducing duplication

## Known Issues

1. **Mobile Experience**: Some components need better mobile adaptation
2. **Bundle Size**: Large dependency tree impacts performance
3. **Documentation Gaps**: Some advanced features lack detailed documentation
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Limited support for older browsers

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Component-based Approach**: The decision to use a component-based architecture has proven successful, allowing for flexibility and maintainability
2. **TypeScript Adoption**: The use of TypeScript has improved developer experience and reduced errors
3. **Context Providers**: The use of React context for configuration has simplified component implementation
4. **Schema Validation**: JSON Schema validation has ensured data integrity

### API Evolution

1. **Block API**: The block API has evolved to support more features while maintaining backward compatibility
2. **Theming Support**: Theming support has been enhanced to provide more flexibility
3. **Animation Control**: Animation settings have been refined for better performance and user experience
4. **Custom Block Integration**: The API for custom blocks has been improved for easier integration

### Release Strategy

1. **Semantic Versioning**: The project follows semantic versioning for releases
2. **Alpha/Beta Releases**: Alpha and beta releases are used for testing new features
3. **Release Branches**: Separate branches are maintained for different major versions
4. **Automated Releases**: GitHub Actions automate the release process

## Next Milestones

1. **Version 7.0.0**: Major release with breaking changes and new features
2. **Enhanced YAML Support**: Better support for YAML format
3. **Mobile-First Approach**: Redesigning components with a mobile-first approach
4. **Performance Optimization**: Comprehensive performance improvements
5. **Accessibility Compliance**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
