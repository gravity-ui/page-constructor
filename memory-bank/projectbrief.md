# Project Brief: Page Constructor

## Overview

Page Constructor is a React-based library for rendering web pages or their parts based on JSON data. It uses a component-based approach where a page is built using a set of ready-made blocks that can be placed in any order. Each block has a specific type and set of input parameters.

## Core Components

1. **Server Side**: Provides utilities for transforming content, including Yandex Flavored Markdown (YFM) to HTML conversion.

2. **Client Side**: React components for rendering blocks and pages.

3. **Editor**: User interface for page content management with real-time preview.

4. **Widget**: Embeddable component for displaying page constructor content.

5. **Storybook**: Component documentation and visual testing environment.

## Key Features

- Component-based page construction
- Theming support (light/dark)
- Customizable blocks and sub-blocks
- Responsive grid system
- Navigation components
- Internationalization support
- Analytics integration
- Maps integration
- Server-side rendering support
- Form handling (Yandex Forms, Hubspot)

## Technical Requirements

- Support for React 16.14.0 and above
- TypeScript for type safety
- SCSS for styling
- JSON schema validation for block data
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Accessibility compliance

## Project Goals

1. Provide a flexible and extensible system for creating web pages
2. Enable non-technical users to create and edit pages through the editor
3. Support theming and customization for different brand requirements
4. Ensure performance and accessibility across devices
5. Facilitate easy integration with existing React applications

## Target Users

1. **Developers**: Who integrate the library into their applications
2. **Content Creators**: Who use the editor to build pages
3. **End Users**: Who view and interact with the rendered pages

## Success Criteria

1. Easy integration with existing React applications
2. Comprehensive documentation and examples
3. Performance optimization for large pages
4. Accessibility compliance
5. Extensibility for custom blocks and functionality
