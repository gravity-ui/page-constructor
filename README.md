## Install

```shell
npm install @gravity-ui/page-constructor
```

## Page constructor

`Page-constructor` is a library for rendering web pages or their parts based on `JSON` data (support for `YAML` format is to be added later).

When creating pages, component-based approach is used: a page is built using a set of ready-made blocks that can be placed in any order. Each block has a certain type and set of input data parameters.

For the format of input data and list of available blocks, see the [documentation](https://preview.yandexcloud.dev/page-constructor/?path=/story/information--blocks).

### Getting started

The page constructor is imported as a React component. To make sure it runs properly, wrap it in `PageConstructorProvider`:

```jsx
import {PageConstructor, PageConstructorProvider} from '@gravity-ui/page-constructor';

const Page: WithChildren<PageProps> = ({content}) => (
  <PageConstructorProvider>
    <PageConstructor content={content} />
  </PageConstructorProvider>
);
```

### Parameters

```typescript
interface PageConstructorProps {
  content: PageContent; //Blocks data in JSON format.
  shouldRenderBlock?: ShouldRenderBlock; // A function that is invoked when rendering each block and  lets you set conditions for its display.
  custom?: Custom; //Custom blocks (see `Customization`).
  renderMenu?: () => React.ReactNode; //A function that renders the page menu with navigation (we plan to add rendering for the default menu version).
  navigation?: NavigationData; // Navigation data for using navigation component in JSON format
}

interface PageConstructorProviderProps {
  isMobile?: boolean; //A flag indicating that the code is executed in mobile mode.
  locale?: LocaleContextProps; //Info about the language and domain (used when generating and formatting links).
  location?: Location; //API of the browser or router history, the page URL.
  analytics?: AnalyticsContextProps; // function to handle analytics event

  ssrConfig?: SSR; //A flag indicating that the code is run on the server size.
  theme?: 'light' | 'dark'; //Theme to render the page with.
  mapsContext?: MapsContextType; //Params for map: apikey, type, scriptSrc, nonce
}

export interface PageContent extends Animatable {
  blocks: Block[];
  menu?: Menu;
  background?: MediaProps;
}

interface Custom {
  blocks?: CustomItems;
  subBlocks?: CustomItems;
  headers?: CustomItems;
  loadable?: LoadableConfig;
}

type ShouldRenderBlock = (block: Block, blockKey: string) => Boolean;

interface Location {
  history?: History;
  search?: string;
  hash?: string;
  pathname?: string;
  hostname?: string;
}

interface Locale {
  lang?: Lang;
  tld?: string;
}

interface SSR {
  isServer?: boolean;
}

interface NavigationData {
  logo: NavigationLogo;
  header: HeaderData;
}

interface NavigationLogo {
  icon: ImageProps;
  text?: string;
  url?: string;
}

interface HeaderData {
  leftItems: NavigationItem[];
  rightItems?: NavigationItem[];
}

interface NavigationLogo {
  icon: ImageProps;
  text?: string;
  url?: string;
}
```

### Custom blocks

The page constructor lets you use blocks that are user-defined in their app. Blocks are regular React components.

To pass custom blocks to the constructor:

1. Create a block in your app.

2. In your code, create an object with the block type (string) as a key and an imported block component as a value.

3. Pass the object you created to the `custom.blocks`, `custom.headers` or `custom.subBlocks` parameter of the `PageConstructor` component (`custom.headers` specifies the block headers to be rendered separately above general content).

4. Now you can use the created block in input data (the `content` parameter) by specifying its type and data.

To use mixins and constructor style variables when creating custom blocks, add import in your file:

```css
@import '~@gravity-ui/page-constructor/styles/styles.scss';
```

### Loadable blocks

It's sometimes necessary that a block renders itself based on data to be loaded. In this case, loadable blocks are used.

To add custom `loadable` blocks, pass to the `PageConstructor` the `custom.loadable` property with data source names (string) for the component as a key and an object as a value.

```typescript
export interface LoadableConfigItem {
  fetch: FetchLoadableData; // data loading method
  component: React.ComponentType; //blog to pass loaded data
}

type FetchLoadableData<TData = any> = (blockKey: string) => Promise<TData>;
```

### Grid

The page constructor uses the `bootstrap` grid and its implementation based on React components that you can use in your own project (including separately from the constructor).

Usage example:

```jsx
import {Grid, Row, Col} from '@gravity-ui/page-constructor/';

const Page: React.FC<PageProps> = ({children}) => (
  <Grid>
    <Row>
      <Col sizes={{lg: 4, sm: 6, all: 12}}>{children}</Col>
    </Row>
  </Grid>
);
```

### Blocks

Each block is an atomic top-level component. They're stored in the `src/units/constructor/blocks` directory.

### Sub-blocks

Sub-blocks are components that can be used in the block `children` property. In a config, a list of child components from sub-blocks is specified. Once rendered, these sub-blocks are passed to the block as `children`.

### How to add a new block to the `page-constructor`

1. In the `src/blocks` or `src/sub-blocks` directory, create a folder with the block or sub-block code.

2. Add the block or sub-block name to enum `BlockType` or`SubBlockType` and describe its properties in the `src/models/blocks.ts` or `src/models/sub-blocks.ts` file in a similar way to the existing ones.

3. Add export for the block in the `src/blocks/index.ts` file and for the sub-block in the `src/sub-blocks/index.ts` file.

4. Add a new component or block to mapping in `src/constructor-items.ts`.

5. Add a validator for the new block:

   - Add a `schema.ts` file to the block or sub-block directory. In this file, describe a parameter validator for the component in [`json-schema`](http://json-schema.org/) format.
   - Export it in the `schema/validators/blocks.ts` or `schema/validators/sub-blocks.ts` file.
   - Add it to `enum` or `selectCases` in the `schema/index.ts` file.

6. In the block directory, add the `README.md` file with a description of input parameters.
7. In the block directory add storybook demo in `__stories__` folder. All demo content for story should be placed in `data.json` at story dir. The generic `Story` must accept the type of block props, otherwise incorrect block props will be displayed in Storybook.

### Themes

The `PageConstructor` lets you use themes: you can set different values for individual block properties depending on the theme selected in the app.

To add a theme to a block property:

1. In the `models/blocks.ts` file, define the type of the respective block property using the `ThemeSupporting<T>` generic, where `T` is the type of the property.

2. In the file with the block's `react` component, get the value of the property with the theme via `getThemedValue` and `ThemeValueContext` (see examples in the `Banner.tsx` block).

3. Add theme support to the property validator: in the block's `schema.ts` file, wrap this property in `withTheme`.

### i18n

To make sure the i18n library used in your project runs properly, perform its initialization and set the project's current locale value in `lang`. For example:

```typescript
import {configure, Lang} from '@gravity-ui/page-constructor';

configure({lang: Lang.En});
```

### Maps

To use maps, put the map type, scriptSrc and apiKey in field `mapContext` in `PageConstructorProvider`.

You can define environment variables for dev-mode in .env.development file within project root.
`STORYBOOK_GMAP_API_KEY` - apiKey for google maps

### Analytics

#### Init

To start using any analytics, pass a handler to the constructor. The handler must be created on a project side. The handler will receive the `default` and `custom` event objects. The passed handler will be fired on a button, link, navigation, and control clicks. As one handler is used for all events treatment, pay attention to how to treat different events while creating the handler. There are predefined fields that serve to help you to build complex logic.

Pass `autoEvents: true` to constructor to fire automatically configured events.

```ts
function sendEvents(events: MyEventType []) {
  ...
}

<PageConstructorProvider
    ...

    analytics={{sendEvents, autoEvents: true}}

    ...
/>
```

An event object has only one required field - `name`. It also has predefined fields, which serve to help manage complex logic. For example, `counter.include` can help to send event in a particular counter if several analytics systems are used in a project.

```ts
type AnalyticsEvent<T = {}> = T & {
  name: string;
  type?: string;
  counters?: AnalyticsCounters;
  context?: string;
};
```

It is possible to configure an event type needed for a project.

```ts
type MyEventType = AnalyticsEvent<{
  [key: string]?: string; // only a 'string' type is supported
}>;
```

#### Counter selector

It is possible to configure an event to which an analytics system to sent.

```ts
type AnalyticsCounters = {
  include?: string[]; // array of analytics counter ids that will be applied
  exclude?: string[]; // array of analytics counter ids that will not be applied
};
```

#### context parameter

Pass `context` value to define place in a project where an event is fired.

Use selector below or create logic that serves project needs.

```ts
// analyticsHandler.ts
if (isCounterAllowed(counterName, counters)) {
  analyticsCounter.reachGoal(counterName, name, parameters);
}
```

#### Reserved event types

Several predefined event types are used to mark automatically configured events. Use the types to filter default events, for example.

```ts
enum PredefinedEventTypes {
  Default = 'default-event', // default events which fire on every button click
  Play = 'play', // React player event
  Stop = 'stop', // React player event
}
```

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Release flow

In usual cases we use two types of commits:

1. fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
2. feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
3. BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
4. To set release package version manually you need to add `Release-As: <version>` to your commit message e.g.

```bash
git commit -m 'chore: bump release

Release-As: 1.2.3'
```

You can see all information [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

When you receive the approval of your pull-request from the code owners and pass all the checks, please do the following:

1. You should check if there is a release pull-request from robot with changes from another contributor (it looks like `chore(main): release 0.0.0`). If it exists, you should check why it is not merged. If the contributor agrees to release a shared version, follow the next step. If not, ask him to release his version, then follow the next step.
2. Squash and merge your PR (It is important to release a new version with Github-Actions)
3. Wait until robot creates a PR with a new version of the package and information about your changes in CHANGELOG.md. You can see the process on [the Actions tab](https://github.com/gravity-ui/page-constructor/actions).
4. Check your changes in CHANGELOG.md and approve robot's PR.
5. Squash and merge PR. You can see release process on [the Actions tab](https://github.com/gravity-ui/page-constructor/actions).

### Beta-major versions release

If you want to release a new major version, you will probably need for a beta versions before a stable one, please do the following:

1. Create or update the branch `beta`.
2. Add there your changes.
3. When you ready for a new beta version, release it manually with an empty commit (or you can add this commit message with footer to the last commit):

```bash
git commit -m 'fix: last commit

Release-As: 3.0.0-beta.0' --allow-empty
```

4. Release please robot will create a new PR to the branch `beta` with updated CHANGELOG.md and bump version of the package
5. You can repeat it as many as you want. When you ready to release the latest major version without beta tag, you have to create PR from branch `beta` to branch `main`. Notice that it is normal that your package version will be with beta tag. Robot knows that and change it properly. `3.0.0-beta.0` will become `3.0.0`
